My NFL Pick'em Statistics for the 2023-2024 NFL Regular Season

As an avid fan of the NFL, I enjoy making predictions on my favorite team, the New York Giants, as well as predictions for other teams. NFL Pick'em is a game where each week you predict the winner of each NFL game.
As someone who is ultra competitive, I like to see how I did and compare it with other people. I also enjoy data science and manipulation and seeing how I did picking certain teams or picking favorites/underdogs. There are
truly so many possibilities when it comes to the NFL. 

Currently, I am working to make this an automated task where I can simply make the picks and not worry about manually calculating or manipulating the data to get a certain stat. This will also allow me to track and compare
my own statistics with my friends.
